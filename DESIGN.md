### maintaining the market
    rabbit_notes (TG):
        "if you charge 5% and add it to the lp, then you are making that charge a common value for everyone to invest in."
        "- when chart is high acquiring new users becomes more costly. when less users its cheap and attractive to use."
        "requiring people to hold some gta to host a game (alone without a fee) plays the role of delaying sell pressure giving a temporary poisitve above zero chart"
        "you have to give people something, and the token something"
        "you have hosts and joiners
            hosts assumes they know a little more than joiners.
            thus they need to be empowered somehow to get that social network effect going to get the wheel to turn"
            
        So your suggestingâ€¦
        1) The hosts need to hold in order to host
        2) a % of each prize pool goes to LP on the dexes
        3) we do not take any fee ourselves at all

        another buy pressure you are adding with the %to pool is: 
            as a host it is smart for me to buy and hodl gta if i intend to play a lot games or bet higher in the future.
            if the amount of gta is a % of the bid deposit then it is more expensive in the future when the chart keeps accumulating. 
            and this very speculation can drive the market otherwise you have a systemic chart with a zero range or at best a delayed sell pressure with a basic hold x amount of gta to use the contract.
    
    maintaining value:
        - % of game's prize pool goes back to dex LPs
        - % of game's prize pool goes to buying GTA off the open market (into GTA contract)
        - host wallets must retain a certain amount of GTA in order to create games
            (probably some multiple of the intended player_entry_fee) 
            
    providing value
    
    1) when we launch the contract, we also create the intial liquidity pools on the dexes (pulseX, 9inch, uniswap, etc.)
        NOTE: we don't need to put up a lot of money at all to start, 
                because liquidity will be added from each game's 'prize_pool'
                 (i'm thinking less than $100, i'll front this money)
        
    2) Q: whats the initial token price?
        A: i don't know, what do you think? rabbit?
            
    3) Q: can winners cash out right away
        A: yes, they can take their wallet and go to any dex and get PLS (or whatever)
        NOTE: the price won't drop because the exact value from the 'prize_pool' will be added to the dexes
            rabbit: please confirm this logic
            
    4) Q: can a malicious host create fake games and fake players?
        A: yes, but they will simply be winning their own money back (and losing gas fees)
        NOTE: the price can't drop when they do this, because their 'entry_fees' will be added to the dexes to cover the sales
            rabbit: please confirm this logic
    
### use case:
    1) someone in the world wants to play a game (any game in the world) and let people win real money from it
        - he is called the 'host'
        
    2) the host picks any game in the world
        - lets use call of duty (COD) as an example, which is a first person shooter game
        
    3) the host initializes the 'game' 
        - 1) creates a game on the COD platform (has nothing to do with our smart contract)
        - 2) creates a 'game' on our smart contract (our contract is an ERC20 token based smart contract and is called "GTA" = Gamer Token Award)
                - when creating the game...
                    the host sets an 'entry_fee' for each player (required)
                    the host sets a 'start_date_time' for the game to start (required)
                    the host may also choose to set a 'host_fee' for being the 'host' (optional)
                        (the host_fee could generally be a percentage of the total 'entry_fees' collected)
                - after creating the game, the host will get a 'game_code' to give to other players he wants to invite
                
    4) the host invites other people to the game
        - 1) host gives people the 'game_code' to use with our GTA smart contract
        - 2) host gives people a link to the actual game to join (on the COD platform or whatever, nothing to do with our GTA contract)
        
    5) players accept invite and join the game
        - 1) players join the GTA contract game, using the 'game_code' they received
                and at this time, they must send their 'entry_fee' to the GTA contract as well
                all the 'entry_fees' received by the contract for this 'game_code', will generate the 'prize_pool'
                NOTE: if the 'host' actually wants to play the game and have a chance at winning the 'prize_pool'
                        then he must also 'join the game' like any other normal 'player'
        - 2) players join the actual COD game on the COD platform or whatever (nothing to do with our GTA smart contract)
        
    6) players play the game
        - players then play the game like normal, on the COD platform (nothing to do with our GTA smart contract)
        
    7) paying out winners
        - 1) host records the winners of the game
        - 2) host uses the GTA contract w/ the 'game_code' to select the winners
        - 3) the GTA contract then automatically pays the winners
        NOTE_1: if the host doesn't select winners after a certain amount of time
                	then all 'entry_fees' are automatically returned to the players
        NOTE_2: if the host lies about who are the winners, then those winners will never play that host's games again
                    (capitalism at its finest)
